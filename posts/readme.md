## Creating Posts
Creating a new post is as easy as creating a new `your-blog-post.md` file in this directory.

## Filename
The filename is used as the blog post URL, so name your posts accordingly, i.e:

```
hello-world-in-ten-languages.md
why-i-like-my-pet-slug-more-than-java.md
javascript-is-better-than-sex.md
```

## Meta Data
Each post starts with three lines that provide meta data about the post, including title and date:

```
title: Blog Post Title
date: Jan 1 2013
---
```

The regular body of the post should come after the `---` line.
